# ClaimGenie AI Features Documentation

## Overview

ClaimGenie integrates Google's Gemini API to provide intelligent, AI-powered features that enhance the insurance claim filing experience. This document outlines the key AI features implemented in the application.

## AI-Powered Features

### 1. Intelligent Claim Chatbot

The ClaimChatbot component uses Gemini API to provide context-aware responses during the claim filing process:

- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language processing for more human-like interactions
- **Context Retention**: Maintains conversation context for more relevant responses
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: Adapts questions based on previous responses

### 2. Claim Amount Estimation

The system uses AI to analyze medical conditions and treatments to estimate claim amounts:

- **Automatic Cost Analysis**: Estimates total treatment costs based on condition and treatment
- **Coverage Calculation**: Determines the portion likely to be covered by insurance
- **Explanation Generation**: Provides rationale for the estimated amounts

### 3. Policy Coverage Analysis

AI helps determine whether a specific medical condition and treatment are covered by the user's policy:

- **Treatment-Policy Matching**: Analyzes if treatments are likely covered
- **Exclusion Detection**: Identifies potential policy exclusions
- **Coverage Recommendations**: Suggests alternative approaches when coverage is uncertain

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **geminiApi.js**: Core utility for interacting with the Gemini API
   - `generateGeminiResponse()`: General-purpose function for AI responses
   - `estimateClaimAmount()`: Specialized function for amount estimation

2. **claimHelper.js**: Manages claim data with AI integration
   - `updateWithAIEstimation()`: Incorporates AI estimates into claim state
   - `generateClaimSummary()`: Creates summaries with AI-estimated amounts

3. **ClaimChatbot.jsx**: Front-end component that leverages AI capabilities
   - Integrates real-time policy coverage checking
   - Displays AI-estimated amounts and explanations

### Data Flow

1. User provides medical condition and treatment information
2. System sends this data to Gemini API with policy context
3. AI analyzes the information and returns:
   - Estimated total cost
   - Estimated covered amount
   - Coverage explanation
4. Results are displayed to the user and incorporated into the claim

## Prompt Engineering

The system uses carefully crafted prompts to generate high-quality responses:

```javascript
// Example prompt for claim amount estimation
const prompt = `
You are an insurance claim estimation expert. Based on the following information:
- Medical condition: ${condition}
- Treatment received: ${treatment}
- Policy type: ${policy.policy_type}
- Coverage categories: ${JSON.stringify(policy.coverage_details)}

Please estimate:
1. The total cost of this treatment
2. The amount likely to be covered by insurance
3. A brief explanation of your estimate
`;
```

## Future AI Enhancements

Planned improvements to the AI features include:

1. **Fraud Detection**: AI analysis to identify potentially fraudulent claims
2. **Treatment Recommendations**: Suggesting alternative treatments with better coverage
3. **Claim Success Prediction**: Estimating the likelihood of claim approval
4. **Document Analysis**: Extracting information from uploaded medical documents
5. **Personalized Coverage Advice**: Recommending policy adjustments based on claim history

## Configuration

To customize the AI integration:

1. Adjust temperature settings in `geminiApi.js` to control response creativity
2. Modify prompts to emphasize different aspects of analysis
3. Update safety settings to match your organization's requirements
4. Fine-tune token limits based on response complexity needs

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Inconsistent Estimates**: Adjust prompt specificity for more consistent results
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling and caching
- **Response Latency**: Consider pre-generating estimates for common conditions
- **Context Window Limitations**: Optimize prompts to include only essential information
